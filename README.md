Project Cars Dedicated Server Blacklist for griefers

After another night of frustration i've decided to write down the steamID's from players that are griefing online and known for it. The game is meant to be a great race simulator but there are always a few that intentionally mess up, what could have been, a great race by griefing. Sadly enough proof of that can be found online. 

I wanted to help the community out by creating a list of known griefers and their steamIDs so serveradmins can put them on the blacklist of their server configurations. Please find the list on the link below. 

# Only griefers
Be aware that this list is not for people that accidentally drove someone of the track. Its for those who are deliberately spoiling the fun for others. This list can be used on a Dedicated Project Cars server.

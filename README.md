# pCars-DS-Blacklist
Project Cars Dedicated Server Blacklist for griefers

After another night of frustration i've decided to record the steamID from players there are griefing online in the game pCars. The game is meant to be a great simulator but there are always a few that mess up, what could have been, a great race. 

# Only griefers
Be aware that this list is not for people that accidentally drove someone of the track. Its for those who are deliberately spoiling the fun for others. This list can be used on a Dedicated Project Cars server.
